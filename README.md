# Astronomy_project2021

### About project:
This project aims to detect **HI** with CRAFTS data and **AI** algorithm.
This journey began in March 2021, and will end in March 2023.<br>
**Acknowledgement**<br>
This project is supported by **NKU** and **NAOC**.
Datasets are supported by **CRAFTS**.

### Current Status:
Since raw datacubes are too big to use our neural network, we decide to use **slide window** and apply neural network in every slice of big datacubes. 

### About Repository:
Contain some of my codes using in this project.
- data: preprocess CRATFS raw data.
    - generate: generate virtual signals
    - gridding: regrid raw data
    - tools: scripts to process raw data 


### About us
Main partcipators are all from NKU -- School of Physics, School of Mathematical Sciences and College of Software, respectively.
Supervisors of this project are from NAOC and NKU.<br>
