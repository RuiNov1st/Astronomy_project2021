# Astronomy_project2021

### About project:
This project aims to detect **HI** with CRAFTS data and **AI** algorithm.
This journey began in March 2021, and will end in March 2023.<br>
**Acknowledgement**<br>
This project is supported by **NKU** and **NAOC**.
Datasets are supported by **CRAFTS**.

### Current Status:
We are trying to use **Gridding data** as neural network's input. And Due to the lack of real datasets, we have to regenerate **virtual signals** to enrich our datasets.

### About Repository:
Contain some of my codes using in this project.
- data: preprocess CRATFS raw data.
    - Generate: generate virtual signals
    - Gridding: regrid raw data


### About us
Main partcipators are all from NKU -- School of Physics, School of Mathematical Sciences and College of Software, respectively.
Supervisors of this project are from NAOC and NKU.<br>
